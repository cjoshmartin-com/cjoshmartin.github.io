1. **WRITE SHIT DOWN!!**

2. Do not spend time with people who are not motivated to be **always working**.

3. **Choose creative activities** that has a means to an end. For example, instead of going to out and spend money that you probably don't have and wasting productive time. You could spend your time doing something free, like drawing or dancing or going for a walk. These task will only take up a few hours of your time but are an investments in future energy.

4. Always **put career/school in front of spending time with friends** and pursuing love interest. People come and go but the only consistent thing in your life will what you do with it as a whole.
  * Also, anyone that tries to stop you from reaching your potential isn't a person you should have in your Life.

5. **take care of your body** eat good, excise, shower. It sometimes feels like you could have more important things to do, but trust me it is again a investment in your future performance.

6. **Keep a constant routine.** I personal hate doing this, but I understand it's importance. It makes me able to make so many chooses through out the day.       

7. In your Free time, **try new SMALL activities**, its like stretching your brain and keeps your life interesting.

8. Have a well organized system for watching out for deadlines.

9. Start on all projects/work ASAP!!

10. Use breaks to be productive in other parts of your life.  Go do the dishes, or take out the trash.

11. **Most things are relative, you create your own reality.** It's  all about your perceptive and what you want to do with your life.

12. Read Books! I have problems with reading and do not take the time read books either, so I listen to a lot of audiobooks.
