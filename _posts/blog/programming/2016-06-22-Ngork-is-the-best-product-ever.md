THIS THING IS SO AMAZING! When I was a Junior in high school (around 2013-2014), I bought a raspberry pi and watch some tutorials on how to create a PPTP VPN on a linux server, So I could look at instagram photos and get on twitter in class and at lunch. THE HARDEST PART of this whole process was setting up/managing the port forwarding on my TERRIBLE stock AT&T 2Wire router. It was so hard to set-up because of all the menus and even though I had a static IP it would still break and I would have to reset the whole thing! I also exposed my network to the whole internet, so anyone could of hacked me. Well ngork fixes these problems I had! All I had to dois sign-up for account, download the ngork file and unzip it in the project I am working on then simply run the command
    ./ngrok http 80  
To proxy my localhost to there server!!! So I could access my local network from anywhere, securely!
