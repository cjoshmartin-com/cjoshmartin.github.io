God! How I have missed programming in school... At first, it is a headache to learn and spend time with, but after while it is a lot of fun! This is Technically my second programming class in college but the first one was a Engineering C programming class and this is a REAL CS class. It has been quite interesting!

**The of this class difficulty of this class so far:** I would rate it a 2 of 10. It has not been that hard.
