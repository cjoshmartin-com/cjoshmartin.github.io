        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p> Hello! My name is Josh. I am a Sophomore, studying Computer Engineering, at IUPUI. Furthermore, I am minoring in Computer Science and Math.</p>

        <h3>Aspirations </h3>
        <p>
          I hope one day, I could become a great programmer👨🏻‍💻 or hardware engineer to be able to make a postive impact on my community and equally important be able to build cool sh*t! (like, an all electric porshe 944 controlled by a huge touch screen running android auto!)
        </p>
        <h3>Learning style</h3>
        <p>
          I am a Kenesthetic learner. Lectures bore me😴, I much prefer to learn hands on and to teach others. However, always willing to learn and, always wanting to grow and push myself.
        </p>
        <h3>Why this Website?</h3>
        <p>
          I made this website to have some where to practice, and sharpen my skills. I have regretted it since! lol. So many handaches caused by this website but they are good headaches, I guess haha? 💁🏻 Everything on this site is always metaphorically ducktaped together and could explode at any moment but I always try to find better glue or more tape when I can.
        </p>
        <p>
          This site is using Jekyll to generate the static pages, Bootstrap to handle the grid and layout "system" and, uses modernizer and Jquery to generate the magic js code!
        </p>
        <h3>Me Personally</h3>
        <p>
          I am light hearted and always trying to make someone laugh.I enjoy breakdancing, and watching youtube videos. I spend a lot of my time studying. I am also in the Computer Science Club and the Filpino Student Association at my college.
