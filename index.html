        <u>about me:</u><br>
        I am a (freshman) computer engineering student, and work as a IT Assistant part-time at a local high school.
         I have been programming since my sophomore year of high school, and have been involved with technology since
         I was able to speak.<br><br>
         In my freetime, I like to breakdance and lift weights.
